We choosed to make a responsive website in Html and Php/MySQL
in order to offer to the client a fully personalise website instead of an 
industrial typical website made by a CMS.

That give to the design aspect total freedom. 

We have made a landing with page with a big picture with an image of the galleria, because it is supposed to represent an art project so the design is very pure. 

Also a slider give the user a first idea of the artworks.

The websites gives the possibility to the user to register, however he needs to have a minimal income. That allows to the user to communicate with the admin. 

The admin (Don Diege) can create artworks, edit them et delete them according to his wish thanks to the back office. 

We also have used MD5 encryption for the admin password to give 
a minimal security design.  

We didn't have much to realize all the functionnalities so the API payments is not implemented yet, and the filter by countries in collection section. 

We will also git an interactive map for the next version.
