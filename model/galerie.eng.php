echo("Beatriz Gil gallery linked to the arts circuit of the Las Mercedes urbanization, in Caracas, was founded in June 2004, in a space that traditionally was always connected to the city's cultural environment. For more than fifteen years, we have consolidated ourselves as a space that watches over the support, promotion and diffusion of the different plastic manifestations of the new national talents. Our mission is to build bridges of approach to the proposals of young emerging Venezuelan artists, who have continuously built a coherent discourse over time, expressed in different techniques and genres.");
